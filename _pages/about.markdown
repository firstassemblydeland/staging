We believe, in keeping with Jesus’ Commandment to “Go”, that we have the privilege of speaking blessing, peace, and salvation over our community. As a result, God has given us both favor and opportunity to meet the heartfelt needs of those around us. This is in keeping with our mission statement, “Caring for Individuals and Strengthening Families.”

We lovingly reach out to our neighbors as lighthouses of prayer as well as to our community through Project Light to the homeless and needy, community calls to prayer, and outreaches into the marketplace, schools and those in governmental leadership.

As a result of over a million hours of prayer and meeting the needs of those around us, we have seen God transform our city from being called “deadland” to “DeLand of Milk and Honey.”

Each of our staff has experience in the marketplace before coming to First Assembly DeLand. Our hearts are united in our desire to care for our community. It’s our desire that every person in our city have the opportunity to receive the Love of God and His Salvation through His Son, Jesus Christ.
