First Assembly DeLand’s mission is to care for individuals and strengthen families. Each of our ministries plays a strategic role in caring for you and strengthening your walk with Christ. We want you and your family to feel connected and at home in our church. Whether you’re single, married, with kids, or without, we have something for everyone! Ministry is often defined as “service”. And not only do our ministries serve you and your family, but we also want you to catch the vision and get involved. One way to get connected is to serve with a team of dedicated people like you. Be a part of a volunteer ministry team that gathers to serve others inside and outside of the church. Check out the various ways we have to serve you and your family, and then let us help you get plugged in.

## Children

Children’s Church: Truth Trackers Sundays 10:00am Kepler Campus – Room 100 Children of all ages are welcome at First Assembly. There is a class for every age group with appropriate teaching methods including puppets, drama, games, videos, music and fun. Our faithful Children’s ministry team combines all this to share the incredible love of Jesus.

## Youth

Our youth ministry at First Assembly can be described with one word: RESCUE. Rescue is a word that implies saving, but also is defined as “preserving”. We want to see teens get involved and stay involved. Our activities throughout the year include mission trips, youth conferences, local community events and services, annual outreaches, and concerts to keep teens connected.

## Women

The First Ladies, our women’s ministry at First Assembly DeLand, is a vibrant group that welcomes women of all ages and of all backgrounds. As a ministry that always strives to be relevant, we encourage each other in transparency, righteousness and a deep desire for the King. We are committed to inspiring women to become more and more in tune with God’s voice and with His ways. We have monthly women’s meetings, weekly Bible studies, a spring conference and many other events throughout the year.
